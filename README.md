# ESP8266-WiFi-PWM
A simple sketch to control whatever you want from your phone or PC using PWM on the ESP8266.

In my case, I use it to control my room lights with the help of a mosfet to handle the demand for power, but really you can use it for anything that requires you to remotely control PWM.
